📂 Project Structure
The project structure follows a standard convention for a modern React application built with Vite, ensuring a clear and organized development workflow.

└── README.md
src/: This directory contains all the source code for your application.

src/components/: A folder for your reusable React components. Each component has its own JSX file and a corresponding CSS file for easy maintenance.

App.jsx: The main application component that manages the search logic and overall application state.

App.css: Contains the global styles for the app, including the media queries for the responsive layout.

index.css: The base stylesheet, typically used for universal rules like font families and body margins.

main.jsx: The entry point of your application, responsible for rendering the App component to the DOM.

vite.config.js: A configuration file for Vite, often used to set up a proxy to prevent CORS issues with third-party APIs.

package.json: The project manifest file that lists all dependencies, scripts, and other project metadata.

🚀 Technologies Used
This application is built with a set of modern and powerful technologies for a fast and efficient development experience.

React: The core library for building the user interface.

Vite: A next-generation build tool that provides a fast development server and an optimized build process.

Axios: A popular promise-based HTTP client for making API requests.

CSS (Vanilla): The application's styling and responsive design are handled with standard CSS and media queries.

ESLint: A static code analysis tool that helps maintain code quality and enforces a consistent coding style.

⚙️ Installation and Usage
Follow these steps to get the application running on your local machine.

Prerequisites
Make sure you have Node.js installed.

1. Clone the Repository
Bash
```
git clone https://github.com/your-username/my-music-app.git
cd my-music-app
```
2. Install Dependencies
Use your preferred package manager to install the project's dependencies.

Bash
```
npm install
# or, if you use yarn
# yarn install
```
3. Run the Application
Once the dependencies are installed, you can start the development server.

Bash
```
npm run dev
```
The application will be available at http://localhost:5173. If that port is already in use, Vite will automatically find and suggest another one.
